# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Evolution of immunological memory and the regulation of competition between pathogens.**   
Wodarz D. _Curr Biol_ 2003 Sep 16;13(18):1648-52
[13678598](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13678598) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Memory is a central characteristic of immune responses. It is defined as an
elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of
infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of
immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed
so far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and
the transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models
are used to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological
memory: the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between
different pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting
protection against reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species
to persist. This can be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is
more virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an
inferior pathogen species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if
the inferior pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen
diversity memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under
specific circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the
presence of pathogen diversity.
